Problem Statement: 
The decision to purchase a house depends on multiple factors such as property characteristics, customer financial status, neighborhood safety, and lifestyle preferences. Real estate companies often struggle to predict whether a customer will actually proceed with buying a property, which affects marketing strategy, loan processing, and business forecasting.

This project aims to develop a Deep Learning–based Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model that predicts whether a customer will decide to purchase a house. The model is trained on a comprehensive dataset that includes property features (type, size, price, furnishing status), customer financial details (salary, loan amount, monthly expenses, down payment), and neighborhood metrics (crime cases reported, connectivity score, satisfaction score).

Using these 23 input features, the ANN learns complex non-linear patterns to classify the final decision as either:

1 → Customer will buy the house

0 → Customer will not buy the house

The final system is deployed through a Streamlit application, allowing real-time predictions based on user inputs.
This solution helps real estate agencies, loan providers, and investment analysts make data-driven decisions, improve lead conversion, and optimize customer engagement strategies.
